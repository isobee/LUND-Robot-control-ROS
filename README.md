# LUND-Robot-control-ROS

This is a repository dedicated to storing ROS code created for the Husqvarna Lawnmower (located in ut_driver), which works in conjunction with the code given out by the Husqvarna research group. 

We have also added python code for controlling a crazyflie drone (located in crazyflie_scripts), used in conjunction with the crazyflie python lib from Bitcraze. 

These files can be used together to allow the lawnmower to work as a mobile drone platform. 

Check out the Resources for more info and our two How-To Guides.
